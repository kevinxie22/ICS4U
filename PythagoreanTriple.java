 * S509/ICS4U1-11 ( Unit 1 - PythagoreanTriple)
 * 
 * Create a PythagoreanTriple application that displays all 
 * pythagorean triples with values of A and B less than 100. 
 * A pythagorean triple is a set of three integers that make 
 * the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 true. The application should
 * include a PerfectSquare() method with three parameters and 
 * prints the resulted  Pythagorean triple in the form 
 * a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .
